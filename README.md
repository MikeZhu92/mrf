# Project Name

mrf - Markov Random Field

A library to solve global optimization problems in the domain of range sensing.

## Installation

Install the [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/).
Resolve dependencies to other mrt packages.

## Usage

A generic library to solve global optimization problems in the domain of dense surface representations.
It is usually combined with the 'mrf_tool' to preprocess input data and use the output.
