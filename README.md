# mrf

Markov-Random-Field based guided depth upsampling and reconstruction given camera images and laser observations.

For further information, please refer to our publication "Guided Depth Upsampling for Precise Mapping of Urban Environments", presented at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2017, Redondo Beach, CA, USA.

## Installation

Dependencies required:
- [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/)
- [Point Cloud Library](http://www.pointclouds.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)

You can use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build this package.
However, we recommend using [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin) which is part of [ROS](http://www.ros.org/).

## Usage

The 'Solver' class represents the interface for depth upsampling.
It is initialized with a camera model and an optional parameters structure.
Please refer to 'parameters.hpp' for hints on the different parameters.
To solve a depth upsampling problem a 'Data' structure must be provided that consists of a 3D point cloud, a feature image and a transform between laser and camera.

Please refer to the 'mrf_tool' for exemplary applications.
